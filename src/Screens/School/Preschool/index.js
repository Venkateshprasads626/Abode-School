                 0 - 6 yrs is called the 'Sensorial Plane'. Our Preschool Program is from 3 to 6 years of age. During this phase, 
                 every child experiences an innate urge to explore, work, learn and discover the world around them.
                  This is the most sensitive stage in a childâ€™s life, an age of explosive learning, where learning happens by absorbing information in an enriched PREPARED ENVIRONMENT.
